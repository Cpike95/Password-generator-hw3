# Password-generator-hw3

I have created a password generator that has a user select their password criteria. 
The user will select the red Generate password button to begin the process.

The user will type a number in the first prompt box to select the length of their password, and they must input a number ≥8 and ≤128. 

The user will then be prompted to select either Ok or Cancel to add in lowercase letters, uppercasse letters, numbers and symbols. 
If Ok is selected it will add a list of those character types to the password. 
If "Cancel" is selected it will not add those character types to the password.

Once all of the character types have been selected or prompts have been answered a random password will be generated based on the users selected criteria and added to the page.
